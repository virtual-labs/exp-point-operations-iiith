The experiments are designed to understand and learn the effect of different gray-level transformation functions. This experiment consists of four experimentations:

   1. Linear

   2. Non-linear

   3. Clipping

   4. Windowing


Steps to run the experiments

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

   - Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

   - Select appropriate parameters to see the effect

2. Select one option from 'linear', 'non-linear', 'clipping' and 'window'

   - For linear option, select the value of slope and offset

   - For non-linear option, select the value of c .

   - For clipping and window option, select values for paraemeters a (start), b (end) and the slope

   - With the change in the parameters, the corresponding transformation function will be display in the left below panel

3. Select Run option to perform the operations

   - Output result will be displayed in the output panel along with intermediate results
