The experiments are designed to understand and learn the effect of different gray-level transformation functions. This experiment consists of four experimentations:

1. Linear

2. Non-linear

3. Clipping

4. Windowing

Steps to run the experiments

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

   1. Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

   2. Select appropriate parameters to see the effect

2. Select one option from 'linear', 'non-linear', 'clipping' and 'window'

   1. For linear select the value of slope and offset

   2. For non-linear select the value of c .

   3. For clipping and window option, select values for paraemeters a (start), b (end) and slope

   4. With the change in the parameters, the corresponding transformation function will be display in the left below panel

3. Select run option to perform the operations

   1. Output result will be displayed in the output panel

   2. Along with intermediate results
